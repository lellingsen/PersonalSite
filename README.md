# Lars Ellingsen's Personal Site

Welcome to my site's repository! The main purpose of it is to hold myself accountable for learning some new technologies and rekindling my love for hands-on software development.

This site is built using:

- Gatsby
- TypeScript
- NodeJS
- Tailwind CSS

and is deployed using Netlify.

Please feel free to make an issue if you notice any problems!
