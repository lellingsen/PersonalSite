Welcome to my blog! The plan is to write about code, technology, and learning. I plan to document my journeys learning new tools and languages.

I'm an 8-year IT/software veteran who transitioned into a management role a few years back. My intention is to cement my learning by summarizing and clarifying what I've done, as well as provide a resource to others looking to do the same.

This site is being made using the `gatsby-starter-blog` template, created by Kyle Matthews. Thank you Kyle for helping me to get started faster!

I'm choosing Gatsby to help myself learn React, GraphQL, and to learn more about the JAM Stack in general. This type of site seems perfectly suited to the static-deployment model of Gatsby. The plan is to deploy the site on Netlify and eventually overhaul the styling with Tailwind. However, to avoid being overwhelmed, I'm taking things one step at a time.
