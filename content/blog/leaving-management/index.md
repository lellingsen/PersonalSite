## Background

Since my last blog post, a lot has changed for me, both personally and professionally. I have switched jobs - twice - and am now a Senior Software Engineer at Dashlane. Moving from a role in which I was managing other managers to one in which I am an independent contributor (IC) again within a year has been quite a shift.
