I recently finished the book _The Manager's Path_, which I very much enjoyed, and have been wanting to write up my thoughts on it so that I better remember my takeaways. Authored by Camille Fournier, it was published only a few years ago, and unlike many leadership books I found it extremely relevant and in line with my own experiences. I've begun recommending it to any of my senior developers who are interested in going into leadership. The following are some sections that I found particular value in.

## Real vs. Imagined Life of Senior IC & Manager

This was perhaps my favorite section of the book. It's early on, and was the part of the book where I knew for sure that I would finish it. In my experience, it is an extremely accurate summary, and had me laughing at parts such as this description of the imagined life of a senior developer:

> Because of your seniority, the managers ask you for your advice on how to approach development before it begins, so you know everything that's going on but you don't really need to deal with the details of the people building it. You're invited to just the right set of meetings where the important decisions are made, but not so many as to disrupt your flow.

Anyone who has been involved in software development for a while can likely see the unrealistic optimism in that sentiment - but it is absolutely one that I've seen before, and that I had myself as an IC. In most companies, being present only for the "right" meetings is a pipedream. We all have to deal with some inefficiencies at the individual level - one could argue this helps the efficiencies of the group as a whole (by not having to bring people in/out of meetings all the time and the logistics involved there), but whether it's that or just poor planning, it's a fact of life.

Similarly, I've found when talking about the possibility of going into leadership, most people focus almost exclusively on the positives - training, coaching, having more decision making authority, etc. Very few realize the potential downsides that I had to learn the hard way. This section from the real life of a manager sums up a few particularly important points:

> Your team does not naturally just agree with you, respect you, or even like you. You realize that authority requires more than a title. You find yourself scrambling to motivate them through tough periods when the projects aren't going well, or when you have to tell individuals that they aren't ready to be promoted just yet, that they aren't getting a raise, that there's no bonus this year.

The first main point is that being given a title does not equate to leadership. People have to _want_ to follow you. Manager Tools, another great management/leadership resource that I frequently use, talks about it in terms of three forms of power: Relationship Power, Expertise Power, and Role Power - power meaning being able to get things done, or in leadership terms, the influence one has. They're more or less what they sound like - relationship power is based on trust and interpersonal skills, expertise power is due to others knowing about your knowledge, and role power is based on title and comes from the organization. Ideally, you want to use them in that order - rely on relationship power as much as possible, expertise power when you have to, and role power when you have no other choice. _You_ have some control over your relationship and expertise power, but not role power. In addition, using role power is basically a strong-arm move, and will leave the other party displeased; if you're having to resort to "do it this way, because I'm the boss," there's likely something wrong with what you're asking for. Even if you're promoted to be "the boss," you still have to work (hard) on relationships and knowledge.

The second part is about tough conversations. There are a lot of those that I've had to have over the years. From dealing with interpersonal conflicts, to explaining to someone who isn't as self-aware the things they are doing wrong, to giving bad news about the company (like low/no raises), there are a lot of situations in which you will have to deliver bad news or deal with non-engineering matters that will upset your directs. In addition, early on I sometimes delayed having these tough conversations, because I was dreading how they would go. I've learned over time to "run to my problems" and get them over with sooner rather than later. Your team will normally want to know as early as possible, and leaving it for later just makes the stress last longer.
